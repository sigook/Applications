    </p>
    <p>
      SIGOOK<label class="superscript">®</label> WORK FACTORY (dba of COVENANT GROUP INVESTORS LLC, Florida) and our
      affiliated COVENANT GROUP LTD.,
      Ontario-Canada ("Company" or "We") respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance
      with this policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the personal information of our customers and
      website users ("you"), describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you
      visit and/or use our website (https://www.sigook.com), software and/or mobile or desktop application called
      SIGOOK<label class="superscript">®</label> (collectively, "Sigook"), which provide dedicated interaction between you
      and Sigook, and our
      practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only use your personal information in accordance with this policy unless otherwise required by applicable
      law. We take steps to ensure that the personal information that we collect about you is adequate, relevant, not
      excessive, and used for limited purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Privacy laws in Canada generally define "personal information" as any information about an identifiable individual,
      which includes information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a
      single person. Personal information does not include business contact information, including your name, title, or
      business contact information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is defined by the US Department of Labor as Any representation of
      information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by
      either direct or indirect means. Further, PII is defined as information: (i) that directly identifies an individual
      (e.g., name, address, social security number or other identifying number or code, telephone number, email address,
      etc.) or (ii) by which an agency intends to identify specific individuals in conjunction with other data elements,
      i.e., indirect identification. (These data elements may include a combination of gender, race, birth date,
      geographic indicator, and other descriptors). Additionally, information permitting the physical or online contact of
      a specific individual is the same as personally identifiable information. This information can be maintained in
      either paper, electronic or other media.
    </p>

        or services, you can opt-out by using one or more of the following applicable opt out mechanisms: checking the
        relevant box located on the form on which we collect your data or logging into your account and adjusting your
        user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes. If we have sent you a

      our various obligations for retaining records, retention periods may vary. For example, we will retain a copy of
      your contact details if you object or opt-out of receiving direct marketing communications from us. We will add your
      details to our suppression list to attempt to comply with your request not to receive any future marketing
      communications from us. Also, we will not delete personal information if relevant to an investigation or a dispute.
      It will continue to be stored until those issues are fully resolved.
    </p>
    <p>We use the following criteria to determine retention periods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        how long the data is needed to provide staffing and managed services and operate our business;
      </li>
      <li>
        whether there are contractual or legal obligations that exist that require us to retain the data for period of
        time;
      </li>
      <li>
        whether any law, statute, or regulation allows for a specific retention period;
      </li>
      <li>
        whether an individual has agreed to a longer retention period;
      </li>
      <li>
        whether the data is considered to be sensitive data, and
      </li>
      <li>
        what the expectation for retention was at the time the data was provided to us.
      </li>
      <li>
        To meet our obligations when acting as an employer in connection with the contract of employment and other
        obligations which apply to us under applicable employment laws;
      </li>
      <li>
        To manage the employment relationship with an individual, including for human resources management (for example
        career development, training, talent management, performance management, appraisals, and disciplinary and
        grievance management);
      </li>
      <li>
        To meet our obligations to an individual in respect of our contract with the individual when we act as an
        employment agency, recruiter, hirer, outsourcing or related professional services agency;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In all cases, we will continue to protect your personal information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy
