        <h4>EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY POLICY</h4>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      SIGOOK is firmly committed to creating a climate where the different perspectives that diversity brings to the
      business are valued. Attracting and developing a diverse workforce that reflects the communities we serve is at the
      foundation of this goal. Viewing diversity as an asset is essential in cultivating a workforce that reflects the
      changing face of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIGOOK is an equal opportunity employer, and it is a continuing policy of SIGOOK to afford equal employment
      opportunities in all aspects of employment (including but not limited to job selection, hiring, promotion,
      termination, compensation, training and benefits) to all individuals without regard to race, color, religion, sex or

        <h4>AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT</h4>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the ADA Amendments Act, and our own internal policies and
      culture, SIGOOK will endeavour to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with known disabilities
      upon request in order to enable them to apply or perform the essential functions of their job, so long as the
      accommodation does not impose an undue hardship. We will engage in an interactive dialogue with all individuals
      requesting accommodations. Some examples of potential accommodations include providing assistive devices,
      reassignment to a different position, and/or finite periods of leave; however, each situation and position is unique
      and will be analyzed individually to ensure that both an accommodation can be provided and that no undue hardship
      occurs as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
      An applicant or employee who believes they require an accommodation in order to apply or perform the essential
      functions of the job should contact the employee’s Company Representative and/or the Human Resources Department at
      <a href="mailto:appmanager@sigook.com">appmanager@sigook.com</a> to request accommodation. The individual should
      specify what accommodation they believe is needed. To the extent medical records are required to evaluate a
      reasonable accommodation, SIGOOK will preserve the confidentiality of such medical records. During the period when
      SIGOOK is reviewing the individual’s request, information concerning the disability will be shared only with those
      who have a business need to know. If it will not impose an undue hardship, an accommodation will be made or an
      alternative accommodation will be proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIGOOK does not deny employment to or discriminate against individuals with disabilities, and it will not retaliate
      against individuals for requesting an accommodation. SIGOOK prohibits discrimination against job applicants in
      employment screening and hiring processes. SIGOOK provides job applicants with reasonable accommodations in the
      screening and hiring processes, including reasonable accommodations regarding the administration and use of any
      pre-employment test. When alerted to the need for accommodation, SIGOOK will engage job applicants in the
      interactive process to provide reasonable accommodation.
