# Splash Screen Setup

## Logo Placement
Please save the Sigook logo image as:
```
assets/images/logo/sigook_logo.png
```

The logo should be a PNG file with a transparent background for best results.

## Design Features
The new splash screen includes:
- **Modern blue gradient background** (deep blue to light blue)
- **Decorative background circles** for depth
- **White rounded container** with subtle shadows showcasing the logo
- **Bold "SIGOOK" branding** with "WORK FACTORY" tagline
- **Smooth fade and scale animations**
- **White loading indicator** instead of red
- **Fallback UI** if logo image is missing (factory icon + text)

## Color Scheme
- Deep Blue: `#0D47A1`
- Primary Blue: `#1565C0`
- Medium Blue: `#1976D2`
- Light Blue: `#42A5F5`
- All red colors have been removed

## Next Steps
1. Save the uploaded Sigook logo to `assets/images/logo/sigook_logo.png`
2. Run `flutter pub get` to update dependencies
3. Test the app to see the new splash screen
